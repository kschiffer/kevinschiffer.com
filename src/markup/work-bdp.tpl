          <b>This project is a redesign study of the official website of bianco di puro, a high quality blender manufacturer.</b><br><br>
          While their strenth undoubtedly lies in their design and products â€“ their official website has trouble to live up to the
          expectations and so, this redesign study was conceived.<br> The objective was to give the site a fresh feeling and to lay focus on the products and the delicious recipes
          that can be done using their blenders. The study involved a research of competitors, user research and wireframing.
